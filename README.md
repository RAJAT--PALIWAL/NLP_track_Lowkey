# NLP_track_Lowkey
This track is being designed to learn about Natural Language Processing, focuses on a student perspective without a PhD.

Whenever encountered with a thought or a problem, to associate ourselves with that thought it's important to know about it as much as we can. To do this we need to ask three set of questions WHY, HOW, WHAT.(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp0HIF3SfI4). This will also help the person taking this course to choose the subset in which they want to specialize in.

# Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing is the branch of Artificial Intelligence concerned with **Analysis, Generation, Summarization** of Text data.
## Why

Let's Start with Topics covered under NLP One by One. I'll try to keep them short and atomic.

# Text Classification
Text Classification is technique for taking text data and assigning a class or label to that data. Text Data can be a document, sentence or word.

 ## Why
This technique is useful for solving problems where we have to automate process of understanding the queries or clustering the document sets. For example, Companies like Ola, Swiggy, Flipkart etc. receive lot of customer complaints & queries everyday. These queries come in large volumes and if satisfactory response is not provided within time, Customers can leave for other services. Response to these queries has to be generated from the concerned department, Like in Ola if you are facing issue with Bill, it should go to the Billing department and if you are facing issue with app itself, it should be sent to Development team. Doing this manually can lead to a bottleneck and choke the whole system. Here, Text Classification comes in and helps us tagging queries with correct labels and sending to concerned team.
