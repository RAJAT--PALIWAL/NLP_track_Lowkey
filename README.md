# NLP_track_Lowkey
This track is being designed to learn about Natural Language Processing, focuses on a student perspective without a PhD.

Whenever encountered with a thought or a problem, to associate ourselves with that thought it's important to know about it as much as we can. To do this we need to ask three set of questions WHY, HOW, WHAT.(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp0HIF3SfI4). This will also help the person taking this course to choose the subset in which they want to specialize in.
